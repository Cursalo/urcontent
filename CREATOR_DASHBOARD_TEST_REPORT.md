   Expected: Full dashboard with stats, charts, and data
   Load Time: <3 seconds
   Console Errors: None
   ```

3. **Responsive Design**
   ```
   Test Viewports: Mobile (360px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1024px+)
   Expected: Proper layout adaptation

   ```

4. **Data Display**
   ```
   Stats Cards: All numbers display correctly
   Charts: Render without errors
   Tables: Sortable and filterable
   Images: Load with proper lazy loading
   ```

### ‚úÖ PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

#### Bundle Analysis
