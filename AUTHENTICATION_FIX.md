# Authentication Fix Documentation

## Problem Identified
The authentication system was failing due to **Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policy recursion** in the `users` table.

**Error Code**: `42P17` - "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation users"

## Root Cause
1. Users could sign up successfully in Supabase Auth
2. But when the app tried to create a profile in the `users` table, RLS policies caused infinite recursion
3. This prevented user profiles from being created, breaking the entire authentication flow

## Solution Applied

### 1. Immediate Fix (Applied)
- Modified `AuthContext.tsx` to handle RLS policy errors gracefully
- Added fallback profile creation using auth metadata when database profile fails
- Users can now authenticate even when database profile creation fails
- Added detailed error logging to identify specific issues

### 2. Database Fix Required (SQL Script Created)
Run the `supabase_setup.sql` script in your Supabase SQL Editor to:
- Drop problematic RLS policies
- Create simple, non-recursive policies  
- Add automatic user profile creation trigger
- Grant proper permissions

## Files Modified
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added error handling and fallback profile
- `supabase_setup.sql` - Database fix script (needs to be run manually)

## Testing Status
‚úÖ Supabase Auth API works correctly
‚úÖ User signup creates auth record  
‚úÖ App now handles RLS policy errors gracefully
‚úÖ Fallback profile system prevents auth failures
‚ö†Ô∏è  Email confirmation required for login (expected behavior)
üîß Database policies need manual fix via SQL script

## Next Steps
1. Run the `supabase_setup.sql` script in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Test complete registration and login flow
3. Verify user profiles are created correctly in database

## Quick Test
The authentication should now work even with the RLS policy issue. Users will see console warnings about database profile creation, but authentication will still succeed.
